Notes from this lesson: 
- pound sign in javascript give it an Id. jQuery. eg. #string1 
- elem/e commonly used to call a html element 
- elem = $('#num'), elem.val() // will return the value assigned to the thing called #num 

- when ordering js files in the index.html, make sure you are not referring to a function that is only defined in a later script because it runs the .js scripts in order. 

- events!!
